# autoBajaEbooks
A script made with love in python, which automates the process of ebook download for the website www.bajaebooks.com, to the not-so-computer-skilled people.

###Dependencies
Requires ebook-convert, coming from calibre (http://calibre-ebook.com).  Go to Preferences, select Miscellaneous in Advanced, and click the "Install command line tools" button.

My script is already including epub2mobi.py from Juan Reyero. https://github.com/juanre/epub2mobi

###Instructions
Just copy the link to your favorite book into the script and the download begins automatically. It will download the book in *EPUB* format in the same folder that the script was executed.
